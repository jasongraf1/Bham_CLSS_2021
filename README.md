# Web scraping with R

This is the repository of tutorials for the Webscraping with R session at the 2021 Corpus Linguistics Summer School at th University of Birmingham. 

This repository is designed to be a self-contained RStudio project, that can be replicated (with a few changes) by anyone. The changes involve the API keys and tokens, which I have not supplied, and will need to be obtained separately. 

Raw R code is available in the `scripts_R` folder, but note that this code assumes that you have the same subfolders used here. Rmarkdown reports can be found [**here**](https://jasongraf1.github.io/tutorials/webscraping_with_R_tutorial_part1.html) and [**here**](https://jasongraf1.github.io/tutorials/webscraping_with_R_tutorial_part2.html). 

Most recent session information (package versions, etc) can be found in `sessionInfo.txt`.
