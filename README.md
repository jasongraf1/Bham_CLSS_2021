# Repo for my Corpus Linguistics Summer School 2021 session

This is the repository of tutorials for the Webscraping with R session at the 2021 Corpus Linguistics Summer School at th University of Birmingham. 

This repo designed to be a self-contained RStudio project, that can be replicated (with a few changes) by anyone. The changes involve the API keys and tokens, which I have not supplied, and will need to be obtained separately.
